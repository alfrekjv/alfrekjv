## Hi There! こんにちわ 👋

I design and build digital products. Sometimes to learn, most of the time for customers at [juvasoft.com](https://juvasoft.com) where I lead a small team of UX Designers and Engineers.

Even though I have a strong background in engineering, curiosity driven by my ADHD has put me at the fine intersection of Business, Design, and Technology.

- 🎨 UX Design / Research / Strategy
- 🚀 Full-stack Web Development (ReactJS / GatsbyJS / NodeJS / ExpressJS / K8S)
- 🎯 Product Strategy
- 📝 Product Marketer
